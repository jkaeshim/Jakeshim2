**Title: My Experience with the AP Computer Science Principles course**

Hey there, fellow students! I wanted to share some insights into the AP Computer Science principles course I'm taking. This course is designed to provide a three-year pathway covering various aspects of computer science, including Full Stack Web Development. The cool part is that it's not just the teachers creating content, students like me also get to contribute and be listed as authors for the content we help create. 

We're using languages and frameworks like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, and Java. The course is structured to build a solid foundation in these languages over the three years. Here's a bit more about how it's all set up:

**GitHub Pages**

My website is hosted on GitHub Pages. It's pretty neat because it's all managed within GitHub's infrastructure. They use a tool called Jekyll to turn our content into static websites and blogs. 

I can see my changes immediately as I work on files in GitHub. Every time I make a change, a GitHub Action kicks in to rebuild and publish the site with Jekyll. It's all powered by Jekyll.

**Setting Up a Preview Site**

Before I publish anything, it's crucial to test our code to make sure its fully functional. I have a development cycle that goes like this: make-code-save-preview. This means we should always preview our work on our local machines before we upload it to GitHub.

I use something called macOS for running a preview server. This is important because it helps us see how our changes will look before they go live on the web.

On Mac, I set up Terminal and then clone the GitHub repository. There's a script to run to get everything ready. It's pretty cool because it sets up the whole environment for us.

**Running a Preview Server**

Once everything is set up, I can start our preview server. This lets us see our website locally. It's like having our very own sneak peek before I show it to the world.

To start the server, I run a command, and it tells us the address where I can see our site. I can make changes, save them, and see the updates in real time. It's like magic!

When I save something, the server regenerates our site. I just need to refresh our browser to see the changes. If there are any errors, I'll see messages in the terminal.

If I want to stop the server or clean up some files, I have commands for that. It's all about managing our development environment.

**Conclusion**

So, that's a glimpse of how I used VsCode for AP Computer Science principles course. It's not just about coding; it's about understanding the entire world of computer science. And I enjoyed the first trimester a lot.
