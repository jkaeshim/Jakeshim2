## Week 4 Plans

# Monday
Familiarize myself with the instructions for the team quiz in sections 1.1 to 1.4, ensuring readiness for Wednesday.
Finish the blog post on lists and dictionaries. With your partner's assistance, execute the following exercises:
Expand the InfoDb with additional entries.
Experiment with a for loop using an index as a fourth iteration method.
Collaboratively innovate with code that uses loops and data structures. Consider these ideas:
Can you output the data in reverse?
What other operations can you perform on lists?
Enhance the InfoDb dictionary, potentially using user input.
Design a quiz that employs a List of Dictionaries for storage.
# Tuesday
Progress with the coding tasks for the 1.1 to 1.4 team quiz.
Take advantage of the shortened class period to achieve as much as possible.
# Wednesday
Brush up on agile methodology principles.
Form a team of four members.
Start developing your agile methodology framework.
Review your code with the teacher and strategize for upcoming tasks.
# Thursday
Continue refining the agile methodology with your team.
Further prepare the code for the 1.1 to 1.4 team quiz.
# Friday
Dedicate the day to Python and Flask learning and development.
