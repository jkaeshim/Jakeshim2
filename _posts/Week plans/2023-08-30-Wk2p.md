## Week 2 Plans

Acquire the knowledge to create a custom theme, which involves understanding theme structures, styling, and possibly theme development frameworks or tools.
Understand the integration of CSS and Python into a webpage, which could entail learning about templating engines, server-side CSS preprocessing, or inline styles within Python-generated HTML content.
Implement an embedded calculator and a simple game into blog pages, which will require learning about embedding interactive elements and possibly some JavaScript alongside HTML.
Enhance your understanding of HTML formatting and syntax to improve the structure and readability of your web content, including getting familiar with HTML5 elements and their proper use.
