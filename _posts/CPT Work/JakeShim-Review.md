***What I did***

-In our CPT project, I engaged with several critical components, working collaboratively with my team. We focused on integrating the NBA API into our project, a task which involved understanding complex data to improve the functionality of our application. This part was particularly intriguing as it allowed us to bring real-time basketball statistics and information into our project, making it more relevant and engaging for users.

In addition to the technical work with the API, I took on the part of improving the visual appeal of our project. Using SASS, an advanced version of CSS, I contributed to the design aspect, focusing on creating an aesthetically pleasing interface. This required a balance between functionality and style, ensuring that our application was not only useful but also visually attractive to our target audience.

A significant part of my contribution involved the integration of the frontend and backend systems. By implementing sqlite3 for our database management, I helped establish a seamless connection between user interactions and our data storage solutions. This was crucial for functionalities like user registrations and login systems, ensuring that our application could securely manage user data.

The development of a functional login page was another area where I contributed significantly. It was essential to create a secure, efficient, and user-friendly login system that could protect user privacy while providing easy access to their personalized settings and preferences.

Throughout this project, my focus was on ensuring that our application was not only technically robust but also user-friendly and visually appealing. Balancing these aspects required a deep understanding of both the technological tools at our disposal and the design principles that make an application appealing to its users.

As a 10th grader, taking on these responsibilities was both challenging and rewarding. It allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, enhancing my understanding of software development and design. This project was a valuable learning experience, teaching me the importance of teamwork, technical skill, and creative thinking in the development of digital solutions.
