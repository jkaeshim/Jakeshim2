During this passion project I worked on numerous things for our group project. A couple of the main things I did was make the website look good, and coded the song and show api, as well as using postman to incorporate those ai into our code. I also assisted with frontend backend linking, and getting the metadata to work. I made it so for our song and show api, there was a dropdown menu where you choose a genre and it displays certain artists or shows correlating to that genre along with a picture. I also helped with the title and subsections of our website.
