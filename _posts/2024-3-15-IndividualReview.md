In our CPT project, I played a key role in enhancing our application by integrating the NBA API for real-time basketball statistics, which was a complex but rewarding task. Additionally, I focused on improving the visual appeal of our app by utilizing SASS for design, ensuring it was both functional and aesthetically pleasing. I also contributed to integrating the frontend and backend systems, utilizing sqlite3 for database management to facilitate secure user interactions such as login systems. This project provided me with valuable insights into software development and design principles, highlighting the importance of teamwork and practical application of technical skills.
